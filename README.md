🩸 Blood Report Analyzer – AI Internship Debugging Task
Submission Type: Debugging Assignment + Extra Features Implementation
Submitted By: [Your Name]
Task Status: ✅ All Primary Issues Resolved | ✅ Both Bonus Features Delivered
Final Status: Production-Ready & Scalable System

🔍 Project Summary
This project was part of a technical evaluation for an AI internship, focused on identifying and fixing critical issues in a flawed codebase. The original system included serious bugs, insecure code, and unreliable features. This assignment required debugging, ethical validation, architectural improvements, and production-level enhancements.

🎯 Objectives Completed
 Critical Bug Fixes

 Medical Safety Measures

 Bonus #1: Integrated Task Queue (Celery + Redis)

 Bonus #2: Persistent Database Storage with SQLAlchemy

 Scalable Architecture: Dockerized & Production-Ready

✅ Debugging Summary
Resolved 7 Major Bugs: Fixed API logic, imports, LLM setup, file processing

Security Enhancements: Removed misleading health suggestions

Compliance Features: Ethical disclaimers and responsible content practices

Full System Recovery: End-to-end PDF blood report analysis restored

⚙️ Feature Additions
1️⃣ Task Queue Integration
Implemented background processing with Redis + Celery

Added real-time worker monitoring with Flower

Built support for retrying failed tasks using exponential backoff

2️⃣ Persistent Storage
Used SQLAlchemy ORM for database modeling

Enabled file hash checks to avoid duplicate analysis

Audit trail and metadata tracking for every submission
